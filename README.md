# The Quick App For Ruby on Rails

We're working on a building a quick start app for Ruby on Rails projects. It may eventually branch in to others, but for now we're just building the basics.

# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...

# Git-Flow Branches
We use the standards set below by the defaults for git-flow

Branch name for production releases: [master]
Branch name for "next release" development: [develop]

How to name your supporting branch prefixes?
Feature branches? [feature/]
Release branches? [release/]
Hotfix branches? [hotfix/]
Support branches? [support/]
Version tag prefix? []



# Ruby on Rails Starter Apps
The purpose of this project is to build a simple set of Ruby on Rails starter apps that everyone in the Rails community can use to build apps faster and better.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
system dependencies
local dev dependencies
Ruby ???
Rails ???
Bundler ???


```

### Installation
A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

### Database Setup
Set database as pg
Create database
Initilize database
Seed database

## Configuration
More to come...

## Testing
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Services
* job queues
* cache servers
* search engines
* analytics
* backups
* daily summaries
* etc.

## Deployment
Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With
* Ruby
* Rails
